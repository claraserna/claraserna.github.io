      "My name is Clara, I used to work in the travel industry as a chief flight attendant, flying a lot and being little time at home. This experience made me realize how important it is to make our house a home in order to enjoy the place we inhabit in therms of quality; making each corner an experience and living in warmth, comfort and functionality.<br> As a result, I decided to study Interior Design. I consider myself as a dynamic, creative, decisive and determined person; looking for new challenges with the aim of acquiring practical and theoretical knowledge within the interior design world.",
