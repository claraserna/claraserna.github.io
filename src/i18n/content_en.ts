      "My name is Clara, I used to work in the travel industry as a chief flight attendant, flying a lot and being little time at home. This experience made me realize how important it is to make our house a home in order to enjoy the place we inhabit in therms of quality; making each corner an experience and living in warmth, comfort and functionality.<br> As a result, I decided to study Interior Design. I consider myself as a dynamic, creative, decisive and determined person; looking for new challenges with the aim of acquiring practical and theoretical knowledge within the interior design world.",

By removing the kitchen wall, we were able to generate a luminous open concept space that improves the rooms dynamics and its inhabitants communication. Taking advantage of the remaining wall, it was possible to create a bar.<br>We took into account the latest trends with regards the calcareous tiles boom, and were able to come up with a versatil, dynamic, with color accents design, in which you can find three-dimensional shapes. The tiles were applied in the flooring as well as in the walls, this way, both kitchent and bathroom, were connected through the hallway which continues the design seamlessly.<br>The original parquet flooring was preserved, polished and waxed to keep it as natural as possible.<br>Plumbing, electric and gas installations were replaced.",
